tube tracking things

I really don't think it's necessary to say anything here. This isn't really meant to be a repository that's useful for anything, just a sort of backup in case for some terrible reason http://www.mit.edu/~jonesr/ no longer contains all the animated gifs. Also, the new github dashboard is guilt tripping me into adding old unfinished things to feign activity.
